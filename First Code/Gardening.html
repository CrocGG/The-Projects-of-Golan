        <p>Delicate fruits, such as berries and strawberries, sadly bruise and damage easily. The soil, rain, or wind can ruin good fruity crops. Fortunately, you can add a layer of straw underneath the fruit to protect them from damage. A fine layer of barley straw will suffice.</p>
        <p>In recent years, bee numbers have sadly been declining. As an essential pollinator, these busy little insects are essential to sustain a natural ecosystem. Without them, the circle of life for plants would be non-existent! It would also mean no more beautiful flowers or the fruit we eat.
            Small changes in your garden can help bees by providing a rich pollen source. In particular, purple flowers rich in pollen are the most beneficial as bees can see the colour purple more clearly. Flowers you should consider adding to the garden include lavender, crocus, foxgloves, and phlox.</p>
